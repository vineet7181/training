    <pre>Now you want me to tell you
        a history of fish
        while the lake clouds over?
        But don’t you see
        how thirst beats in the throat
        of the lizards on the crushed leaves?
        On the ground
        autumn’s dead hedgehogs
        have plunged through the periwinkles.
        And you chew
        the parched stalks:
        already the corner of your lip is bleeding a bit.
        And now
        you want me to tell you
        the history of birds?
        But in the heat
        of noon, the wild cuckoo
        flies alone.
        And still
        the lost puppy howls among the brambles:
        perhaps the bay horse, running,
        struck him with a black hoof
        on his snout.</pre>
